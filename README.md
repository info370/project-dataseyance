# data-seyance: Possible directions

## 1.  The Effect of Amazon on a City.  
Amazon recently started looking for a second HQ. We want to figure out the pros and cons of having a company with tens of thousands of employees.This may vary from short term effects like strain on public transport to long term effects like overall prosperity or gentrification.

Amazon hires about 40,000 people across 8 million sq. feet in Seattle, and it’s growth is not sustainable for the city. We have a lot of data to see the impact of such a company. We have data like average salaries and increases in cost of living. We can study the effect on gentrification, homelessness, Seattle tech industry etc. 
 
Compare growth rates and progress markers for Amazon employees vs. those for the city. We could compare the effect of Amazon to that of Microsoft. While similar in scale, Microsoft is known for being cognizant of city infrastructure and setting up shop outside of the city. This is crucial in understanding the urban sprawl and development of Seattle. There might also be overall economic benefits. 

Once we develop a better understanding of the effects of such a workforce, we can find better suited cities for the company. It should also provide meaningful insights into the mechanisms behind gentrification and fostering a tech industry.

## 2. Does the use of body-cam by police reduce the reported use of excessive force by officers.
The decision we seek to inform is whether the behavior of police, specifically the rate at which it is recorded/reported that they have used “excessive force” has been affected by the required use of body-cams. 

Our hypothesis might be that because cops have the added scrutiny of the cameras there behavior will be affected in a measurable way, perhaps with less force because they are aware how their footage can be used to implicate them.There have been lots of news articles about police body cams and plenty of articles about the use of force by police, which leads us to certain notions that cops have an inherent want to use force more than necessary, but that with body cams they temper that instinct. It could be for example that because cops know they have proof of the context of their situation, that actually use force more often and more effectively.

 By comparing the use of body-cams and reported incidents of peculiar police behavior (excessive force, or otherwise) either aggregated across many police jurisdictions or per-jurisdiction over many separate communities we may be able to better understand the effect of police body cams on police behavior

 Either body cams are used or they are not, and this either has some discernable effect on behavior (an increase or decrease in reported excessive use of force) or it has no effect.
