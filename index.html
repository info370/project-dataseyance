            <h1>Affordable Housing in Seattle</h1>
            <p>
                A short study of housing affordability and HALA proposals for excess land in Seattle.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                With the highest rent increase rates in the country, for the 14th month straight, 
                Seattle is considering measures to ensure affordable housing for those at risk. 
            </p>

            <img src="./website/images/HALA_introduction.png"/>
            <p>
                The former Seattle mayor, Ed Murray put together a committee to study and come up with solutions to the housing problem 
                in Seattle. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We plan to focus on Proposal L1 of HALA i.e. whether this proposal should be accepted or not. 
                If the city does act upon it, to what extent?
                <blockquote>
                    For City owned property, the City should mandate that surplus and underutilized properties that are
                    suitable for housing development be prioritized for affordable housing. It should explicitly allow the sale
                    or lease of City-owned land at less than fair market value for affordable housing purposes, recognizing
                    that this comes at a cost to other city needs and general funds. 
                    <br /> <br />
                    When land is not suitable for housing development, the unrestricted proceeds from sale should be
                    dedicated to affordable housing development. The City should also create a mandate for the codevelopment
                    of affordable housing in conjunction with new public buildings and investments such as
                    community centers, libraries, public schools, and other institutions of learning.
                </blockquote>
                </p>
            <p>
                To summarize, the proposal wants to build housing on underutilized land, that the City already owns. 
                If the land isn't suitable for homes, then the proceedings from the sale go directly towards affordable housing.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is only natural to ask how much land the City owns. How much of this is suitable for new homes?
                How many people could we house on this land? At what cost?
                But, before we try to find out whether this is a good solution, we need to understand what is a good solution. 
                HALA was shooting for 20,000 affordable units and 30,000 units added at market price.
                We begin this study by understanding how many people are burdened by the rent they pay. 
                We then move on to the viability of the proposal.
                Let's go down the rabbit hole!

            <h2>How much are people paying right now?</h2>
            <p>
                When we look at income, rent and cost of essentials in Seattle we can understand economic pressures people might be facing.
                We used IRS tax-bracket data for the city of Seattle to establish a starting point for our investigation. Against the tax-bracket data
                we can overlay certain cost values to see how affordability differs for different income-levels. The next most important metric was
                rent data. Using Zillow's API we retrieved rent data for all the zipcodes in Seattle. We calculated the cost of essentials using the
                USDA's nutrition guidelines and cost retrieved from the Bureau of Labor Statistic's average food cost calculations.
                <!-- This is where kyle explains his logic for essentials costs -->
                If you look at the model you will see the varying economic situation for given earners per zipcode, overlayed with our calculated 
                expenses. The entry boxes let you see how different spending levels on rent produce different outcomes in terms of annual extra income.
                Keep in mind that spending varys largely and our initial values are conservative. (Riding the bus, no medical bills, school to pay for, etc)
            </p>

            <p>
                Being able to afford housing doesn't just mean people have enough money out of their total. Money spent on rent needs to
                be a reasonable amount that doesn't limit people in other aspects of life. They need to be able to save and
                spend on other things. This is a rough metric of the quality of life. ...
