            <p>
                When we look at income, rent and cost of essentials in Seattle we can understand economic pressures people might be facing.
                We used IRS tax-bracket data for the city of Seattle to establish a starting point for our investigation. Against the tax-bracket data
                we can overlay certain cost values to see how affordability differs for different income-levels. The next most important metric was
                rent data. Using Zillow's API we retrieved rent data for all the zipcodes in Seattle. We calculated the cost of essentials using the
                USDA's nutrition guidelines and cost retrieved from the Bureau of Labor Statistic's average food cost calculations.
                <!-- This is where kyle explains his logic for essentials costs -->
                If you look at the model you will see the varying economic situation for given earners per zipcode, overlayed with our calculated 
                expenses. The entry boxes let you see how different spending levels on rent produce different outcomes in terms of annual extra income.
                Keep in mind that spending varys largely and our initial values are conservative. (Riding the bus, no medical bills, school to pay for, etc)

                Being able to afford housing doesn't just mean people have enough money out of their total. Money spent on rent needs to
                be a reasonable amount that doesn't limit people in other aspects of life. They need to be able to save and
                spend on other things. This is a rough metric of the quality of life. ...
